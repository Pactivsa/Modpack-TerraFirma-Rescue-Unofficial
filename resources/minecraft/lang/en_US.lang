tfr.quest13.name=§ §lb cast iron anvil 
tfr.quest13.desc=Processing of steel ingot 
tfr.quest14.name=The original blast furnace 
tfr.quest14.desc=Blast furnaces are used to smelt iron ore into liquid pig iron. Pig iron ingot can be machined into steel. The height of the blast furnace determines how much ore, flux, and charcoal it can hold, thus maximizing the amount of ore that can be extracted at a time. The smallest blast furnace has a 1-lattice chimney and requires at least 4 fireblocks and 12 pieces of wrought iron to build. The largest blast furnace is a 5-lattice tall stack, requiring at least 20 fireblocks and 60 pieces of wrought iron to build. A minimum size blast furnace structure is as follows :%n%nC equal  crucible B equal  blast furnace F equal  bellows A equal  air %n%n % first layer :%nAAA% nACA%nAAA% nABW%nAAA% N % R % N Third layer :%nAFA%nFAF%nAFA% nFAF%nAFA% N % N refractory bricks are surrounded by forged iron plates, note: metal sheets do not need to be placed on top or bottom. Place the bellows on one side of the blast furnace, making sure the perforated side faces the blast furnace. %r%n%r%n a nozzle is placed in the blast furnace. When charcoal, flux, and ore are thrown down the chimney, the blast furnace is filled. Activate the blast furnace block by right-clicking it with a starter or flint. Both the blast furnace and the top of the chimney begin to glow. %n%n blast furnace GUI can be opened by right-clicking the blast furnace block. Thermometer: this shows the temperature of the blast furnace. The temperature can be raised by adding more charcoal or by installing bellows on either side of the blast furnace and pumping air. %r%n%r%n ore: How much unmelted ore is in the blast furnace. %r%n%r%n charcoal: how much charcoal is in the blast furnace. Ordinary coal cannot be used in blast furnace, only charcoal can be used. %r note: make sure this bar is always equal to or fuller than the ore bar! %r%n%r%n output: how much liquid metal is ready to be taken out of the blast furnace. To make iron ore in a blast furnace, iron ore is thrown into the top of the blast furnace, along with an equal amount of flux and an equal amount or more of charcoal. Each layer of the blast furnace can be processed into 4 pieces of ore, with igniter or flint to the blast furnace square. To maintain the high temperature, it is recommended to keep the ratio of charcoal to ore at 1:1 or higher after throwing the initial charcoal. If there is more ore than charcoal, the temperature will start to drop. If the ratio of charcoal to ore is at least 1:1 and the temperature is kept high enough with the use of bellows, the ore will start to melt. The ore counter will eventually run out and the output counter will be filled with the resulting metal. %r%n%r% N Once the ore is smelted, the nozzle is worn and you need to place a crucible under a blast furnace to receive liquid pig iron. Continuous blast is needed for smelting steel. 
tfr.quest15.name=How can you do without water 
tfr.quest15.desc=You notice that you now have the property of moisture. Well, shouldn't there be?

tfr.quest16.name=Where does water come from? 
tfr.quest16.desc=A steam boiler explodes when it's dry, so you add water to it... There are two ways to add water, manual and automatic. You need an original bucket to add water by hand. It's easy to make. But it's very troublesome, you need a device to automatically add water to the boiler. %n%n First you can use a water impoundment, one may not be enough, do more. %n%n ordinary water will cause the boiler calcification, it is recommended to use a dryer to produce distilled water.

tfr.quest20.name=Good healthy water 
tfr.quest20.desc=The boiler can be delicate, ordinary water will make the boiler calcification, calcification will make the boiler efficiency reduced. Calcification can be removed with a chisel, but must be removed when the boiler is not pressurized or it will explode. %n is very troublesome, isn't it? So you need distilled water, distilled water doesn't calcify the boiler. Distilled water can be obtained by treating aqueous liquids and solids such as fresh water, sea water, sewage, and even tungsten trioxide with a dryer, but it is the fresh water that is treated most quickly and efficiently. The water from the cluster can be pumped directly into the dryer instead of the original water.

tfr.quest23.name=Hurry up! 
tfr.quest23.desc=There is not only a steel version of the dryer, Invar, titanium, tungsten carbide can do the dryer. Of course, more advanced dryers require more HU. Invar dryer is not much more expensive than steel, and much faster. I recommend a chrome combustion chamber with a chrome iron dryer, chromium is not too expensive to find chromite. If you want to use a titanium chamber, I won't stop you. 
tfr.quest24.name=§ §bl sulfuric acid 
tfr.quest24.desc=Sulfuric acid is very important, it can make hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, processing minerals and so on. To make it you need to make at least two bronze agitators. The first requires a vent to take in the air, the sulfur dioxide you get in the roaster, and a platinum powder or vanadium pentoxide (not consumed) to make sulfur trioxide. The second mixer takes in sulfur trioxide and water to make sulfuric acid. The more, the better! §4%n%n§r To submit a task you need to make a water tank, which is attached to the outlet of the machine to get the liquid.

tfr.quest90.name=Coke oven + 
tfr.quest90.desc=You may have noticed that the original furnace no longer fires charcoal, but has replaced it with a multi-block GT coke oven. The coke oven is a hollow cube of 3x3x3, with the coke oven main square in the center of the front face and other firebricks. Each coke oven requires 25 firebricks and 1 coke oven main square. I want you to collect a lot of clay and make it. The %n%n coke oven needs to be ignited with either the original or GregTech technology after the log or lignite/coal is put in, rather than the legendary cigarette lighter. The machine clicks on the main box to ignite the %n coke oven with 16 threads built in, which is very efficient. A group of coal or pure broken coal mines can be scorched into a group of coking coal, the calorific value can be doubled, and 32,000 l of creostite can be obtained. More creosote can be obtained by coking lignite, but the calorific value of coking lignite is lower. Wood can be scorched into charcoal and a considerable amount of creosote can be obtained. Creosote is the best liquid fuel until the distillation tower is finished. Its calorific value is comparable to that of crude oil. It is easy to make and has no possibility of reprocessing. %n%n§c notice that this task has two pages

tfr.quest100.name=Store a lot of liquid 
tfr.quest100.desc=It is difficult to dispose of creosote produced by coke oven if it accumulates too much. To save money for use in a fluid combustion chamber, you can make the first multi-block tank: a large wooden tank. It can store 432,000 liters of fluid, but don't think about using it to hold corrosive liquids or gases. You can also choose to use it as a distilled water cache. He is arranged in a manner similar to that of a coke oven. 
tfr.quest101.name=The temperature 
tfr.quest101.desc=Different melting POTS have different melting temperatures, as you can see at toolip. This determines the maximum melting point of the metal they can smelt. For example, a ceramic crucible cannot be used to smelt iridium, but chromium can be dry pot. It is important to make a higher melting point dry pot, which allows you to smelt stronger metals. Generally speaking, the dry pot production route is: ceramic - chromium - iridium. For you now, you can get the highest level of dry pot is iridium %n%n in order to avoid the crucible over the temperature melting, you need to make a thermometer to see the crucible temperature in real time. %n%n first take a glass bottle, then you need three cinnabar powder, drop it into a crucible, fill one bottle with 144L liquid mercury. Throw two wooden boards into the combustion chamber to ignite (don't throw too much fuel; mercury can evaporate easily), just enough to convert cinnabar into mercury, which is liquid at room temperature, so don't worry about solidification. Right click on the liquid inside the crucible to get the mercury bottle. Once we have a thermometer, we can monitor the temperature of the crucible at any time without fear of the fryer. One thing you need to be aware of is that you can't make glass bottles right now unless you complete the redstone mission. You can complete a quest behind the blue and red steel anvil to get a bottle of vodka and drink it to get a bottle.

There are five types of nutrition, so eat different kinds of food to get them back. When born, every nutrition of the player is full. As the player's hunger wears off, so do their nutrition bars. In order to replenish their nutrition, players must eat the food category. When players are full, they get extra nutrition, and when they are malnourished, they get more nutrition based on their current nutritional level. %r%n%r%n the first four categories account for 25% of the player's maximum hit points, while dairy adds an additional 25% to the maximum hit points. For example, a starting player without levels may reach a maximum of 800HP(the first four nutrients are filled). If one of the nutrients is empty and the other three are full, the maximum health of the player is 600HP. If the player is full of all five nutrients, their maximum hit point is 1000HP. 
tfr.quest227.name=fruit 
tfr.quest227.desc=Fruit can be obtained in two ways: berry bushes and fruit trees, both of which can be found in the wild. Berry shrubs can be harvested directly by hand and are not reproducible. When the shrub is in season and in the right temperature range, it can produce a new fruit every month. Each berry has a different life span, at the end of which the fruit is removed from the bush. To harvest the fruit, just right click on the bush and the fruit will fall. The harvest weight varies from 3 to 8 ounces. Fruit trees chop off branches with an axe to get saplings. If the trunk remains, it can continue to grow, reproduce and produce more. %n% N tree seedlings do not grow immediately. On the contrary, fruit trees grow slowly, producing branches and leaves one by one. This means that trees will eventually grow back after cutting branches in order to harvest seedlings. But it also means it will take a long time for a sapling to grow to the size of a tree in the wild. The trunk will reach its peak in 30 days, with a branch growing every 20 days and a leaf every 2 days. During the harvest season, the fruit trees will bear one piece of fruit on each leaf. To harvest fruit, right-click or left-click on a leaf and the fruit will fall. A serving of fruit is 4 to 16 ounces. Fruit trees only bear fruit when the current temperature is between 0 and 38. For most cases, the corresponding seasonal temperatures (spring to late fall) are in this range, except in deserts, equatorial jungles, and deep tundra.%r%n

Bake over a fire or cut into grains with a knife. If you want to make a serving of grain last longer, or if you want to make a sandwich, you should make the grain into bread. The grains are ground in a stone mill to make flour, which is then combined with a wooden bucket to make a dough, which is then baked over a fire to make bread. If you grow five food crops, you get the ultimate food: bread to bread to bread to bread to bread to bread to bread

tfr.quest272.name=The bonfire 
tfr.quest272.desc=Bonfires are created by right-clicking the square below them with a flintstone or a igniter on three sticks that fall to the ground. Using a primer may require multiple attempts to successfully ignite. Throwing a straw in it will make the fire ignite more easily. Bonfires that are directly exposed to precipitation will not consume fuel and will eventually go out. To prevent this, place a square over the campfire to protect it. %r%n%r% N Once it is ignited, it will burn out quickly unless more fuel (logs) are added. To reignite it, have at least one piece of fuel in the fuel tank and right-click the campfire with the starter or flint. Bonfires are used to make torches, cook food, and heat primary items 
tfr.quest273.name=farmland 
tfr.quest273.desc=Farmland, also known as soil, contains three basic nutrients for crops, and if there are enough water cubes nearby, your plants can get access to important water sources. By using the water and nutrient patterns of the metal hoe, you can see the nutrient levels of the crops and the availability of water. Planting crops in the soil reduces soil nutrients, and in order to replenish them you have to let the crops lie fallow, use fertilizers, or plant crops periodically that require different nutrient types. Note: some crops, such as soybeans and green beans, require additional nutrients as they grow. Unlike the original, farmland does not return to earth. Nor will any soil be produced by destroying farmland to prevent reuse of nutrients. 
tfr.quest274.name=Animal husbandry: 1 
tfr.quest274.desc=Chickens, cows, horses, pigs and sheep are all livestock. The natural growth of animals in the world is based on the climate of the area. Livestock will follow any kind of refined grain and ear of corn, similar to the original animals will follow wheat, carrots and seeds. The ropes are also used the same way as the original ones to haul away animals. Bears, deer and pheasants are wild animals and cannot breed. Wild animals will be refreshed around the world, except for named animals, or at least tethered once, so that they won't disappear. Intimacy: %n%n all animals have a degree of intimacy that increases the need to interact in some way, such as milking, shearing, riding, raising and naming animals. The exact value of these effects varies from species to species, and some species require more interaction. Familiarity can be improved by performing a specific action every 24 game hours. To raise animals, players must sneak around to provide food so the animals don't get scared. If intimacy does not reach 30% and the animal does not interact with humans for 24 hours, then intimacy will decrease. The domestication of adult animals is limited. Only small animals can be fully domesticated, and intimacy grows faster. Young animals retain 50 percent of their mother's closeness at birth, unless she is close to her maximum intimacy, in which case they retain 90 percent. Stalking an animal shows an intimacy indicator. As intimacy increases, the indicator will fill with red, and when it reaches 100 percent, it will turn gold. A white border means the animal has reached at least 30 percent and will no longer be less intimate. %n%n sex: %n%n animals (excluding squid) have different genders (male or female), determined at random when the animal is born. With the exception of bears, horses and wolves, all animals have visual cues to easily determine gender, such as horns, teeth, breasts and different feather colors. For creatures without visual cues, players can right-click on the animal and the chat window will indicate gender. 
tfr.quest275.name=Animal husbandry: reproduction 
tfr.quest275.desc=All reproducible animals except chickens are fed two animals of different genders together until the heart-shaped particles begin to appear. The animals consumed five ounces of grain each time they were fed, and if both animals had their minds, they would have approached within seconds before the particles disappeared. A successful breeding can be confirmed by right-clicking on the female, which will generate a chat message, "pregnant." Chickens %r%n%r%n chickens %r%n%r%n are bred by using nesting boxes. Each day the hen lays an egg in the nest box. If there is a rooster in the box, the egg will be fertilized. A fertilized egg has a hint of fertilization on it. After three quarters of a month in the box, the fertilized eggs hatch into chicks. Note: this calculation is based on months, not days. So a month-long world has a longer incubation period because there are more days in each month. Pregnancy and babies in all reproducible animals except chickens, the female will conceive directly after breeding. Once a female animal is pregnant, she must pass through the gestation period before giving birth. Note: this calculation is based on months, not days. So longer months can lead to longer pregnancies. When the time for conception is complete, the female gives birth. The time of conception, the time of adulthood, the number of offspring born depends on the type of animal.%n 
tfr.quest276.name=charcoal 
tfr.quest276.desc=If you don't have a home now, come back to this task later. You need a charcoal pit. %n%n hand log stealthily right hit the ground to get a log stack, open empty hand can put up to 16 logs. The smallest version of the charcoal pit is a pile of wood (Max infinite) with four logs inside to ensure that at least one piece of charcoal is produced. Cut a hole in the top, throw a torch into it, light it, and seal it with earth. %n%n players will have about 10 seconds to drop the torch on the ground. Once it catches fire, the charcoal pit must cover any solid lumps that are not flammable. Any exposed log stacks will burn and eventually drop logs, causing the ignition to fail. If the ignition is successful, smoke particles will be released from the covered pit. After 18 hours of play time, the smoke particles will dissipate and the pile of logs will turn into charcoal blocks that can be harvested one at a time with a shovel. Note: only a full log pile can have another log stacked on it, so plan the height accordingly. %n%r%n if there is a gravity-affected block in the pit, such as earth or boulder, the blocks collapse as the logs turn into charcoal, creating air cubes. Most of the larger charcoal pits are made of stone and brick to provide a more durable structure.

tfr.quest279.name=Smelting iron ore 
tfr.quest279.desc=Open the opening of the forge and place eight pieces of charcoal at the bottom of the chimney. %r%n%r%n climbed to the top of the forge and dropped 24 pieces of iron ore, depending on its size, into the chimney. Throw the same amount or more of charcoal on a block of charcoal. Both ore and charcoal should disappear in lumps of charcoal. Note: if the player throws more ore than the forge can hold, the extra ore will float on the charcoal without melting. %n%n right - click on the forge iron block with the starter or flint to activate the forge iron. Both the top of the forge iron stove and the top of the chimney should begin to glow. %n%n When it's done, the glow disappears, and the process takes about 15 game hours. Open the forge iron furnace to obtain the billet. Break the blank iron with a pick. The item will automatically move to the nearest forge block for easy pickup. The %n%n%n iron billet is a porous mixture of iron and slag produced by smelting iron ore in a wrought iron furnace. The product of the wrought iron furnace is a blank cast iron. The iron content of a cast iron billet will have a percentage value, where one hundredth is equal to one metal unit (100 units of ore will produce 100 percent of the cast iron billet, corresponding to one wrought iron ingot). Note: If not enough ore is added to the forge, its iron percentage will be less than 100%, then it cannot be refined and must be put back into the forge to add more ore. Next, you refine, shred, and beat the pig iron with an anvil of bronze grade or higher. You will get your first forged ingot. In order to submit the task please cool the wrought iron ingot in the bucket

tfr.quest284.desc=Storage tanks are a relatively inexpensive and efficient option for storing liquids and gases. In the early stage, we can only make a simple wooden storage tank with a capacity of 8000L. In fact, you only need to use a bone to make glue in a mixing bowl with water to stir, and then right click with a glass bottle to take out the plastic bottle. When we can make stainless steel, we can choose to make a few stainless steel tanks, excellent price performance, capacity of 64000L, no leakage (can store liquid), corrosion resistance (can store corrosive liquid such as sulfuric acid). The most cost-effective tank is the plastic tank, which comes from petroleum fractionation. Put the amount of six ingot plastic into the mould press, and put a steel low temperature treatment mold (small unit mold), supply energy can be made into the plastic storage tank, capacity 32000L, no leakage. Note: the storage tank has an upper temperature limit, please do not hold the liquid of too high temperature, otherwise the tank will be destroyed. One thing you need to be aware of is that you can't make glass bottles right now unless you complete the redstone mission. You can complete a quest behind the blue and red steel anvil to get a bottle of vodka and drink it to get a bottle.%n 
tfr.quest285.name=Combustion chamber guide 
tfr.quest285.desc=The combustion chamber is divided into solid, liquid and gas. The first machine we got was usually a solid combustion chamber made of lead. Here are the pros and cons of the three combustion Chambers. %n%n solid combustion chamber, use solid fuel, all the fuel that can be used in the furnace (except magma) can be stuffed into the solid combustion chamber as fuel. When you want to stop heating, you need to block the front of the combustion chamber and wait for the fuel that is currently burning to burn out. When using a solid combustion chamber for mineral smelting, be sure to wait until the fire is extinguished before pouring. Because the less stuff there is in the crucible, the faster it will heat up. If you leave the crucible empty or near empty without quenching, the temperature will rise rapidly and it will be extremely explosive (in effect, it will melt down). Suitable for equipment requiring long term heating and high fault tolerance, solid combustion Chambers are not recommended after the construction of a distillation column because of the need to manually add fuel and the need to regularly clean the ashes after combustion. %n%n liquid combustion chamber, the safest and most stable combustion chamber, using flammable liquid (various wines, creosote, and various petroleum distillations are suitable for combustion, other oils are too low calorific value). Since the combustion efficiency of combustible liquid is 1L/1ticks, when you want to stop heating, you only need to plug the front side and you can stop heating immediately. When minerals are smelted in a liquid combustion chamber, the heating can be stopped at a higher standard temperature to prevent the liquid from solidifying during pouring. Gas combustion chamber, long acting combustion chamber. The calorific value of propane butane is slightly higher than the calorific value of oil produced by petroleum distillation such as gasoline, and each combustion USES 5~7L to burn 30~42ticks, so the shutdown will be delayed for about one second. Suitable for distillation tower, steam boiler and other long-term heating sources. College%n note: according to find oil, can also decide to use a liquid or gas combustion chamber. The heavier the oil, the less gas it produces and the more oil and solid products it produces and vice versa.

tfr.quest322.desc=It's hard to get enough power to build a grid and start using it on a large scale with a single block machine, so you need multiple blocks. 
tfr.quest323.name=Large boiler 
tfr.quest323.desc=The first barrier to your large-scale power generation should be the boiler. The power of the single block generator and turbine can reach EV. The strongest compact fluidized bed combustion chamber (tantalum and hafnium carbide) also has a heat of 4096HU/t, but the standard power of the best single block boiler is only 512HU/t and 1024SU/t. You can, of course, supply the generator with multiple boilers, but because the GregTech's fluid pipeline is so enigmatic, your turbine may not have a steady supply of steam. So a large boiler is very important for a large amount of electricity generation. It has a base of 9 cubes that can be used to receive HU(usually up to 8 cubes), and at the same time can take all the steam out of one cube and supply it to the turbine.

tfr.quest536.name=Gravitational anomaly 
tfr.quest536.desc=A gravitational anomaly is a naturally occurring special square that cannot be destroyed in the usual way (but you can drop it with water to take it away) and randomly generates a mass when placed. %n%n looks for gravity anomalies in the world, using buckets to turn into litters. %n%n it attracts nearby entities, inflicts damage on creatures, swallows falling objects and entities (swallowing a lower star will cause the gravitational anomaly to explode and destroy), and converts its mass to its own mass. (no mass is retained after being destroyed by running water.) %n%n wear the space-time equalizer in the breastplate position to make the player immune to its attraction. (please note is not immune damage, if the player into the horizon, will still receive damage, and durable values of armor would quickly fall)%n%n its main properties have four, quality, gravitational radius, horizon and destructive (can look up by placing a gravity stabilizer)%n%n quality is its main properties, the other three properties are calculated based on the quality, any abnormal point has a random initial quality, and then according to the material throw, 1 per 1 km material quality. %n%n gravity radius means that it can break the block's range and generate the attraction. The event horizon of %n%n represents its actual size. No matter how strong the cube is, once it is within the event horizon, the cube will be destroyed immediately (except for blocks such as bedrock), the entity within the event horizon will be eaten, and the creature within the event horizon will be harmed. %n%n damage represents the hardest object it can destroy. This value is equivalent to the explosive force of an explosive. A cube cannot be destroyed when its anti-knock ability is higher than that of the bomb and it is outside the event horizon. It also represents the damage done to a creature each time. The main function of %n%n is to power the annihilation reactor.
